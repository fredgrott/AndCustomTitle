# Project Name

AndCustomTitle uses themes and extended Window features of Android to customize
the title bar. Title bar flash is removed by putting a Splash activity as the
point of entry into the application and a call in the Splash activity onCreate
method that sets NoTitle as the Window extended feature to use.
